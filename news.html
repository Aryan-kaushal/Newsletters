        <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/biden-gaffe-122235327-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=jvIOqSIJzDCqzYsWnGq8807nRtS5auOW&size=690:388" alt="Mr. President">
        <p class="para">US President Joe Biden's saga of verbal slips continued as the 81-year-old first introduced Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy as his arch-enemy "Putin", before going on to mix up the names of his Vice President Kamala Harris and rival Donald Trump.n yet another gaffe, US President Joe Biden mistakenly referred to his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy as "President Putin" at a Nato event on Thursday (local time), amid growing concerns over his age and fitness to serve another term.

            Biden, joined by 32 allies and foreign leaders for the announcement of the "Ukraine Compact," a new initiative to bolster aid to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia, was inviting Zelenskyy to speak when he made the verbal faux pas.
            
            "I want to hand it over to the President of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination—please welcome President Putin," Biden said.
            Former US President Donald Trump quickly seized on Biden's flub to unleash on the Democrat. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, he said, "Crooked Joe begins his ‘Big Boy’ Press Conference with, 'I wouldn't have picked Vice President Trump to be vice president, though I think she was not qualified to be president.' Great job, Joe!"

            When asked about Trump mocking him over his verbal blunder, Biden laughed and quipped, "Listen to him."
            
            Later, in a tweet, the US President attempted further damage control with a cleverly crafted response to his Republican rival's jab.
            
            "By the way: Yes, I know the difference. One’s a prosecutor, and the other’s a felon," Biden tweeted, taking a swipe at Trump over his conviction in the hush money case.</p>

            <p class="para">The races, which feature a shorter race on the Saturday before the main event on the Sunday, start with the second grand prix of the season in China on 21-23 March.

                The others are Miami on 2-4 May, Belgium on 25-27 July, the US Grand Prix in Austin on 17-19 October, Brazil on 7-9 November and the penultimate race in Qatar on 28-30 November.
                
                China, Miami, Austin, Brazil and Qatar are also sprint events on this year’s schedule.
                
                Belgium hosted a sprint previously in 2023.
                
                The 2025 F1 season starts in Australia on 14-16 March.
                
                F1 has also released data to demonstrate that audiences are higher for sprint events than for grands prix run to the standard format, which sees two practice sessions on Friday, followed by one on Saturday before qualifying and then the race.
                
                A statement said that live audience figures for the sprint in qualifying and sprint in China this year were 40% higher across F1’s top 15 markets compared to the average practice sessions for the opening two races in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.
                
                F1 chairman Stefano Domenicali said: “The sprint has been a great success for Formula 1, bringing all our fans more action and racing on the track.
                
                “We are seeing the proof of this in our audience data, fan attendance on Fridays and from the promoters and partners.”
                
                F1 will mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the world championship next season and Domenicali said the sprint was “a great example of bringing new elements to our sport in a way that is respectful of the championship”.
                
                There will be no changes next year to the new sprint format that was introduced this season.
                
                F1 bosses discussed making further modifications to the format earlier this year. Those talks will be revisited at a later date but there is no indication of timing or specific changes that might be considered.
                
                The new format this year separated out the sprint from the main grand prix.
                
                There had been a number of different formats before this season, but all mixed together the sprint and grand prix in one way or another - either by having the sprint set the grid for the main race or by having the sprint in between grand prix qualifying and the race itself.
                
                Under the latest format introduced in 2024, a qualifying session that sets the grid for the sprint takes place on Friday afternoon, followed by the sprint as the first track event for F1 on Saturday.
                
                The qualifying session for the main grand prix is run later on Saturday before the grand prix on Sunday.

Raghuvanshi made his IPL debut in 2024 and had a memorable outing with the bat. In 10 innings, he scored 163 runs at a strike rate of 155.24. Raghuvanshi's statement came after Nehwal claimed that sports like badminton, tennis, basketball are physically tougher than cricketers She also criticised the Indian fans for always prioritising cricket over the other sports.

                "Everyone wants to know what Saina is doing, what wrestlers and boxers are doing, what Neeraj Chopra is doing. Everyone knows these sportspersons, because we have consistently performed and we have been on the newspapers. I did that, I feel it's like a dream that I did it in India, where there isn't even a sporting culture," Saina said on the Nikhil Simha podcast.

            <p class="para">For the newly formed BJP government in Odisha, smoothly conducting the annual Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath was the first major challenge, given the arrangements required for the nine-day festival that drew over two million people to Puri.

                The death of a devotee due to suffocation and the collapse of an idol on several people, though, has given the opposition BJD, led by Naveen Patnaik, a handle to target the state government.
                
                In a letter to Chief Minister Mohan Charan Majhi, Patnaik wrote, “The mishap which occurred during Adapa Pahandi of Bada Thakura (Lord Balabhadra) has hurt Jagannath devotees across the globe. I am also deeply hurt. The manner in which Bada Thakura fell on the Charamala (steps of the chariot) was quite heart-wrenching and has never happened in the history of Rath Yatra.” This is the first direct attack on the CM by Patnaik since he took charge as leader of opposition in the state.
                
                On July 9, the idol fell while being taken off the chariot during the Pahandi ritual (ceremonial procession) to Gundicha temple. At least seven servitors sustained injuries.
                
                Though Majhi sent his deputy Pravati Parida and law minister Prithiviraj Harichandan to Puri to monitor the situation, the ministers faced criticism for trying to downplay the incident.

            <p class="para">A 43-year-old house help, who was stuck in a lift for around 45 minutes in a multi-storey apartment here, died after falling on the basement from the third floor of the building during rescue operation, police said.
                The police lodged a case of culpable homicide and handed over the body to her family members after postmortem on Friday morning, a day after the incident.
                
                The woman was identified as Rukmanibai (43), a resident of Shyam Nagar under the RK Puram police station limits of the city.
                
                While the house help was returning to home on Thursday afternoon, she was stuck in the building's lift due to failure of electricity supply. Some women on the same floor heard her cries for help and ran to rescue her.
                
                The house help, during the rescue operation by the women, lost her balance and fell on the rain water-filled basement. She was immediately pulled out of the basement and sent to hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.
                
                The family members and relatives of the dead woman alleged negligence by owners of the apartment and demanded monetary compensation while holding demonstration with the body at the RK Puram police station on Friday morning. However, they agreed to take the body for last rites after assurance of compensation as per government norms.
